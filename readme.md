The homepage allows any user to briefly get acquainted with the
company and its activities by clicking on “About” (1 in Fig.1) in the top
left corner or get the location of the main company’s branch by
selecting “Contact” (2 in Fig.1). Alternatively it can be done by clicking
on either of the images.
